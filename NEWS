Changes in Version 1.0.9

  o return varname as attribute in ifun.

  o Reorder args in xyadj.

  o Fix bug in y2plot with par(mar).

  o Add lag, differences, sort and keepNA to diffid args.

  o Fix bug in predict.sitar concerning id in newdata.

  o Improve handling of ... args in plot.sitar with D and V options.

Changes in Version 1.0.8

  o timegap (new) indexes equally spaced ages, to simplify binning age
    into age groups.

  o Use dynGet instead of get in BICadj.

  o Improve handling of y2 axis in y2plot.

  o Fix bug in plot.sitar introduced in 1.0.7.

Changes in Version 1.0.7

  o Add github URL to DESCRIPTION.

  o Documentation and NAMESPACE now generated by Roxygen2, and S3 methods
    no longer visible.

  o Extend ifun to handle cospi, sinpi and tanpi, and improve documentation.

  o Extend predict.sitar to handle deriv 2 (acceleration).

  o Extend sitar to allow functions in a.formula, b.formula and c.formula.
    Improve documentation for this case.

  o Fix bug in sitar where the start vector is the wrong length.

  o Fix bug in predict.sitar involving default value of yfun argument.

  o Fix bug in predict.sitar for when a.formula, b.formula and c.formula
    involve a single variable.

Changes in Version 1.0.6

  o Tidied up code in predict.sitar and xyadj, altering the defaults for abc, xfun and yfun.
    The asList argument in predict.nlme and level == 0:1 now work correctly.

  o Fixed a bug in predict.sitar involving covariates in newdata (Costanza Pizzi).
    Factors in newdata are now represented as <factor> = <level> rather than
    <factor><level> = [01] as before.

  o Fixed a bug in plot.sitar involving subset with options d and v (Costanza Pizzi).

  o Fixed a bug in plot.sitar involving subset with options D and V.

Changes in Version 1.0.5

  o xoffset and bstart rationalised in sitar and update.sitar. Now xoffset defaults to mean(x)
    and bstart defaults to xoffset, leading to greater stability in model fitting.
    This is a more complete solution to issue 2 in 1.0.4. Note that models fitted
    in previous versions need to be refitted.

Changes in Version 1.0.4

  o update.sitar code updated and simplfied.

  o in sitar and update.sitar the offset for knots and bounds changed
    from bstart to mean(x) (suggestion of Jeroen Sichien).

  o LMS2z loses data argument.

  o LMS2z, cLMS and zLMS now return a vector or a matrix.

  o predict.sitar and plot.sitar now create function fitnlme on the fly when it's missing.

  o sitar handling for weights commented out.

  o ifun bugs fixed and code simplified.

  o man pages updated.

Changes in Version 1.0.3

  o The heights database had age at menarche added.

  o In plot.sitar ifun was used to automatically back-transform transformations
    of x and/or y in the sitar model.

  o ifun (new) inverts an expression defining a data transformation.

  o xyadj (new) adjusts x and y variables for SITAR random effects.

  o predict.sitar was extended with a deriv argument to give predicted velocity.

  o getCovariate and anova methods for sitar were added.

  o	In plot.sitar new options D and V provide spline curves of individual
    distance and velocity curves.

  o	In sitar and plot.sitar bugs were fixed and code simplified by use of
    predict.sitar, xyadj and ifun.

Changes in Version 1.0.2

  o In DESCRIPTION the title and description were corrected, and Suggests
    was changed to Imports.

  o In NAMESPACE lines.sitar and print.summary.sitar were added to S3 methods
    and splines was added to import (both previously omitted in error).

  o predict, getVarCov and getData methods for sitar were added.

  o The sitar command was rewritten to save the function fitnlme, for use
    with predict. As a result the hidden file .fitnlme is no longer created.

  o The plot.sitar command now uses predict to control the number of points
    when drawing spline curves, and any covariate values default to zero.

  o LMSfit was added.

  o lms2z was renamed LMS2z for consistency.

  o	The changes in 1.0.1 to the graphical options xaxsd and yaxsd to deal
    with log scales were corrected.

  o The man files were updated.


Changes in Version 1.0.1

  o The environment for reading the call in sitar, plot.sitar and lines.sitar
    was corrected.

  o	The graphical options xaxsd and yaxsd were extended to deal with log scales.


Changes in Version 1.0

  o First CRAN release of package "sitar" for growth curve analysis.
