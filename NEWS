Changes in Version 1.0.2

  o The description in DESCRIPTION was extended as required, and Suggests
    was changed to Imports.

  o In NAMESPACE lines.sitar was added to S3 methods and splines was added
    to import (both previously omitted in error).

  o predict, getVarCov and getData methods for sitar were added.

  o The sitar command was rewritten to save the function fitnlme, for use
    with predict. As a result the hidden file .fitnlme is no longer created.

  o The plot.sitar command now uses predict to draw the mean curve with 101
    points, and any covariate values default to zero.

  o LMSfit was added.

  o lms2z was renamed LMS2z for consistency.

  o	The changes in 1.0.1 to the graphical options xaxsd and yaxsd to deal
    with log scales were corrected.

  o The man files were updated.


Changes in Version 1.0.1

  o The environment for reading the call in sitar, plot.sitar and lines.sitar
    was corrected.

  o	The graphical options xaxsd and yaxsd were extended to deal with log scales.


Changes in Version 1.0

  o First CRAN release of package "sitar" for growth curve analysis.
