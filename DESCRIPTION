Description: Functions for fitting and plotting SITAR (Super Imposition by
    Translation And Rotation) growth curve models. SITAR is a shape-invariant model
    with a regression B-spline mean curve and subject-specific random effects on
    both the measurement and age scales. 
    The model was first described by Lindstrom (1995) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780141807> 
    and developed as the SITAR method by Cole et al (2010) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115>.
