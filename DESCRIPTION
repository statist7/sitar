Description: Functions for fitting and plotting SITAR (Super
    Imposition by Translation And Rotation) growth curve models. SITAR is
    a shape-invariant model with a regression B-spline mean curve and
    subject-specific random effects on both the measurement and age
    scales.  The model was first described by Lindstrom (1995)
    <doi:10.1002/sim.4780141807> and developed as the SITAR method by Cole
    et al (2010) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115>.
