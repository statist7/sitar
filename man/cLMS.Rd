\title{LMS conversion to and from z-scores}
\description{Routines to handle references constructed with the
LMS method. Given a set of LMS values, the functions convert
z-scores to measurement centiles and vice versa.}
\usage{
zLMS(x, L = 1, M, S)
cLMS(z, L = 1, M, S)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{vector of measurements to be converted to z-scores.}
  \item{z}{vector of z-scores to be converted to measurements.}
  \item{L}{vector of Box-Cox transformation (lambda) values, L in the LMS method.}
  \item{M}{vector of medians (mu), M in the LMS method.}
  \item{S}{vector of coefficients of variation (sigma), S in the LMS method.}
}
\details{L, M and S should all be the same length, recycled if necessary.
The formulae converting \code{x} to \code{z} and vice versa are:
\deqn{z = \frac{(x/M)^L - 1}{L S}}{%
z = ((x/M)^L - 1)/L/S}

\deqn{x = M (1 + L S z)^{1/L})}{%
x = M (1 + L S z)^(1/L)}
where L has 10^-7 added if it is zero. The LMS method is the same as the BCCG family in
the \code{gamlss} package, except that lambda in LMS is referred to as nu in BCCG.}
\value{\code{zLMS} and \code{cLMS} each return a vector or matrix, respectively of z-scores
and measurement centiles, with the number of rows matching the length of
\code{x} or \code{z}, and the number of columns matching the length of L, M and S.
If either dimension is 1 the vector is returned.
