\title{Identify peak or takeoff point of velocity curve}
\usage{
getPeakTakeoff(x, y = NULL, peak = TRUE)

getPeak(x, y = NULL, peak = TRUE)

getTakeoff(x, y = NULL, peak = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector.}

\item{y}{vector.}

\item{peak}{logical determining whether peak or takeoff is returned.}
}
\value{
A length-2 vector containing the values of \code{x} and \code{y} at
the peak or takeoff. If no peak/takeoff is identified NA's are returned.
}
\description{
Given vectors \code{x} and \code{y}, returns their values at the (highest)
peak or (lowest) takeoff point of the smooth (e.g. cubic spline) velocity
curve \code{y ~ x}.
}
\details{
The takeoff point is defined as the lowest velocity before the peak, so if
the curve has no peak there is no takeoff.
}
\examples{
## create mean height velocity curve
data(heights)
m1 <- sitar(age, height, id, heights, 4)
## plot velocity curve
plot(m1, 'v')
## mark peak and takeoff
xy <- plot_v(m1)
points(t(getPeak(xy)), pch=17)
points(t(getTakeoff(xy)), pch=25, col=2, bg=2)
