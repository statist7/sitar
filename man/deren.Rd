  \describe{
  \item{Age}{postnatal age from 7 to 17 completed years}
  \item{Sex}{two-level factor - Boys and Girls}
  \item{N}{integer - group sample size}

  \item{IOTF25}{overweight prevalence based on IOTF reference and 25 cutoff}
  \item{WHO+1}{overweight prevalence based on WHO reference and +1 cutoff}
  \item{CDC85}{overweight prevalence based on CDC reference and 85 cutoff}
  \item{IOTF30}{obesity prevalence based on IOTF reference and 30 cutoff}

\description{
Age-sex-specific prevalence rates of thinness, overweight and obesity in
Ukraine children based on body mass index and IOTF, WHO and CDC cut-offs.
}
\details{
Note that the overweight prevalences are for overweight excluding obesity,
i.e. the prevalence for BMI between the overweight and obesity cutoffs.
}
\examples{
## convert IOTF obesity prevalence to WHO obesity prevalence
## and compare with true WHO obesity prevalence - boys and girls age 7-17
