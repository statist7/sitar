\description{
The UK 1990 revised growth reference (Cole et al 2011) for birth length,
weight and head circumference, fitted by the LMS method and summarised by
values of L, M and S by sex from 23 to 42 weeks gestation.
}
\details{
The growth reference is the birth section of the UK-WHO growth reference
(see Wright et al 2010).

The L, M and S values for each measurement correspond respectively to the
Box-Cox power, median and coefficient of variation of the distribution by
age and sex (Cole & Green 1992). The short names for each measurement (see
\code{\link{LMS2z}}) are as follows: height (ht), weight (wt) and head
circumference (head).

Age is measured in \code{weeks} gestation and \code{years} post-term, where
0 years corresponds to 40 weeks gestation.
