\title{Convert to/from measurement from/to z-score with growth reference}
\usage{
LMS2z(x, y, sex, measure, ref, toz = TRUE, LMStable = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of ages.}

\item{y}{vector or one-column matrix of either measurements or z-scores,
depending on the value of \code{toz}.}

\item{sex}{vector where males = 1 and females = 2.}

\item{measure}{measurement, either as name or character string, the choice
depending on the choice of \code{ref} (see e.g. references \code{uk90},
\code{who06} and \code{ukwhopt}).}

\item{ref}{growth reference, either as name or character string, available
as a \code{data} object or data frame.}

\item{toz}{logical set to TRUE for conversion from measurement to z-score,
or FALSE for the reverse.}

\item{LMStable}{logical set to TRUE to return the associated LMS table as
attribute \code{LMStable}.}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix containing the transformed values. If \code{y}
is a vector then a vector is returned, else if \code{y} is a one-column matrix
then a matrix is returned, with \code{length(x)} rows and \code{length(y)}
columns. The matrix row names are set to \code{x}, and the column names to either \code{y} or
if \code{toz} is FALSE, \code{z2cent(y)}.
}
\description{
A function to convert between measurements and z-scores using a growth
reference previously fitted by the LMS method.
}
\details{
Vectors of L, M and S corresponding to \code{x} and \code{sex} are extracted
using cubic interpolation and passed to either \code{\link{cLMS}} or
\code{\link{zLMS}}, depending on \code{toz}.
}
\examples{

## convert girls' heights data to UK 90 z-scores
data(heights)
data(uk90)
with(heights, LMS2z(age, height, sex = 2, measure = 'ht', ref = 'uk90'))

## construct table of boys weight centiles by age for WHO standard
data(who06)
zs <- -4:4*2/3 # z-scores for centiles
ages <- 0:12/4 # 3-month ages
LMS2z(ages, as.matrix(zs), sex = 1, measure = wt, ref = who06, toz = FALSE)

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{z2cent}}. The LMS method can be fitted to data using
the package \code{gamlss} with the \code{BCCG} or \code{BCCGo} family,
where nu (originally lambda), mu and sigma correspond to L, M and S respectively.
