\title{Create cubic smoothing spline from data}
\usage{
makess(x, y, xfun, yfun)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector giving the values of the predictor variable.}

\item{y}{vector of responses.}

\item{xfun}{optional function to be applied to \code{x} prior to fitting.}

\item{yfun}{optional function to be applied to \code{y} prior to fitting.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{smooth.spline} with the extra component
\code{apv}, a length-2 vector containing the age at peak velocity and peak
velocity. If no peak is identified (based on the 2nd derivative changing
sign) the values are for maximum rather than peak velocity.
}
\description{
A wrapper to fit a cubic smoothing spline to the supplied data, allowing
derivatives to be calculated.
}
\examples{

## create smooth.spline mean height curve
data(heights)
ss <- with(heights, makess(age, height))

## and plot it
plot(ss, type='l', xlab='age', ylab='height')

## age at peak velocity, and peak velocity
print(ss$apv)
