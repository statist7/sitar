\title{IOTF international body mass index reference}
\format{A tibble with 66 observations on the following 5 variables:
\describe{
\item{years}{numeric vector - postnatal age in years}
\item{L.bmi}{numeric vector}
\item{M.bmi}{numeric vector}
\item{S.bmi}{numeric vector}
\item{sex}{two-level factor with level 1 male and level 2 female} }}
\source{
The values are tabulated in the Excel spreadsheet IOTF_LMS.xls
provided with the Excel add-in LMSgrowth from

\description{
The IOTF international BMI growth reference
(Cole and Lobstein 2012), fitted by the LMS method and summarised by values
of L, M and S by sex and postnatal age from 2 to 18 years.
}
\details{
The IOTF cutoffs for overweight and obesity (and also thinness) (see
Cole et al 2000, 2007) can be obtained from this BMI reference.
See the example for how to convert between cutoffs and z-scores.

The L, M and S values for each measurement correspond respectively to the
Box-Cox power, median and coefficient of variation of the distribution by
age and sex (Cole & Green 1992). The measurement short name and units for BMI
are bmi (kg/m2).
