\title{SITAR growth curve analysis}
\description{SITAR is a method of growth curve analysis, based on \pkg{nlme},
that estimates a single mean growth curve as a regression spline, plus a set of
up to three fixed and random effects (a, b and c) defining how individual growth
curves differ from the mean curve. SITAR stands for SuperImposition by
Translation And Rotation.
 
 The package also contains some utility functions for the LMS method, as used to
 construct growth reference centiles (see \pkg{gamlss}).

Effect a (or alpha) measures size, and is a random intercept relative to the
 spline curve intercept. Effect b (or beta) measures tempo, the timing of the growth
 process, and reflects a shift on the x scale relative to the mean. Effect c (or gamma)
 is velocity, and indicates how the x scale is stretched or shrunk reflecting the rate
 at which 'time' passes for individuals. The aim is for individual curves, adjusted for
 a, b and c, to lie on top of the mean curve. 
 
 The package creates an object of class \code{sitar}, based on \pkg{nlme},
 representing the nonlinear mixed-effects model fit. Generic functions such as
 \code{print}, \code{plot} and \code{summary} have methods to show the results
 of the fit. The functions \code{resid}, \code{coef}, \code{fitted},
 \code{fixed.effects}, and \code{random.effects} can be used to extract some of
 its components. The functions \code{devadj} and \code{varexp} compare
 respectively the deviance and variance explained of a series of models, taking
 into account any transformations of the y variable. Functions \code{plotclean},
 \code{velout}, \code{codeplot} and \code{zapvelout} are useful to clean the
 data file.
